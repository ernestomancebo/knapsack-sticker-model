abstract={Our main goal in this paper is to give molecular solutions for two NP-complete problems, namely Subset-sum and Knapsack, in a sticker based model for DNA computations. In order to achieve this, we have used a finite set sorting subroutine together with the description of a procedure to formally verify the designed programs through the labeling of test tubes using inductive techniques.},
